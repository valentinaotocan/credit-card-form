# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser, or on the following link: https://valentinaotocan.github.io/credit-card-form/.

### In the project I used: CRA, react-hook-library, Typescript, SCSS.

### I used the idea from the "Frontend mentor" website.
